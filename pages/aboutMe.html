    <p>
        I have been playing games since I can remember one of my all-time favourite games a series called monster hunter it was one of the first games, I put time and effort into. 
        <br>
        It is what made me start looking into making games both the coding side and the designing side. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Along side my love of games I have had a passion for drawing a painting admittedly not amazing at drawing, but I still enjoy it non the less. 
        <br>
        This has helped in the past with designing characters that could be put into games. However, 
        <br>
        I prefer modelling buildings for games rather than humans and non-humans because Iâ€™m always looking at architecture for ideas.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently using py.game to create a simple top down pixel rpg just to get used to the software and the use of python. 
        <br>
        A few minor and major errors did appear in the coding how ever it was quickly cleaned up, 
        <br>
        the character has a move and an idle animation allowing the character to change depending of the imputs including one for each input, 
        <br>
        the left and right can be flipped then there is one for moving forward and backwards.
